# Customer Orders Database

## About This Project

This project simulates a simple customer and sales tracking database built entirely with SQL.

It includes:
- Two relational tables (`Customers` and `Orders`)
- Basic to advanced SQL queries (JOINs, aggregation, sorting, and conditional logic)
- A sample rewards program classification using `CASE WHEN` statements

The goal was to practice real-world SQL skills such as pulling reports, grouping and ranking customers, and summarizing financial data based on purchases.

## What's Inside

- `schema.sql` — Database structure and sample mock data.
- `queries.sql` — Queries for:
  - Customer purchase reporting
  - Total and average spending analysis
  - Revenue grouped by month
  - Customer loyalty status assignment (Gold, Silver, Bronze)

## Skills Demonstrated

- SQL Table Creation (`CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT INTO`)
- Data Retrieval (`SELECT`)
- Filtering (`WHERE`, `BETWEEN`)
- Joining Tables (`INNER JOIN`)
- Aggregation Functions (`SUM`, `AVG`)
- Sorting Results (`ORDER BY`)
- Conditional Logic (`CASE WHEN`)
- Grouping Data (`GROUP BY`)

## Future Improvements

- Expand dataset to simulate multiple transactions per customer across many months
- Add stored procedures for automatic report generation
- Simulate promotional discounts and dynamic pricing
